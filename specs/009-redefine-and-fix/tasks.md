# Tasks: Redefine and Fix AgentCore Test Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-redefine-and-fix/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are the PRIMARY DELIVERABLE of this feature - reorganizing and rewriting existing tests to follow proper unit/contract/integration categorization.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (test type) to enable independent implementation and testing of each category.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1=Unit, US2=Contract, US3=Integration, US4=Validation)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_*.py`
- Contract tests: `tests/contract/test_*_contract.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_*.py`
- Contract specifications: `specs/008-add-aws-agentcore/contracts/*.yaml`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Ensure test infrastructure and dependencies are ready

- [ ] T001 Verify pytest and aws-cdk.assertions installed in virtual environment
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify boto3 and botocore installed for integration tests
- [ ] T003 [P] Create conftest.py with shared fixtures in tests/ directory

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core test patterns that MUST be established before rewriting tests

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No test rewriting can begin until these patterns are validated

- [ ] T005 Validate UUID naming pattern prevents JSII conflicts in tests/unit/test_agentcore_validation.py

- [ ] T010 [P] Validate quickstart.md test running instructions work for all three test types

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - test rewriting can now begin in parallel by test type

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Validate CloudFormation Templates During Development (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Checkpoint**: Contract tests complete - can validate deployed infrastructure matches specifications

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Test Cross-Stack Integration Behavior (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Integration tests that perform real operations across multiple AWS services

**Independent Test**: Run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/integration/` after deployment - tests perform actual invocations, connections, failover

### Integration Test Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T052 [US3] Add dependency stack validation (skip if NetworkStack/SecurityStack not deployed)
- [ ] T053 [US3] Verify all integration tests skip gracefully when infrastructure not ready
- [ ] T054 [US3] Run full integration test suite against deployed stacks and verify <10min execution time

**Checkpoint**: Integration tests complete - can validate end-to-end behavior across AWS services

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Validate Input Parameters and Error Conditions (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Validation tests that verify CDK stacks properly validate inputs and handle errors

**Independent Test**: Run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/test_agentcore_validation.py` - tests verify invalid configs fail fast

### Validation Test Enhancement for User Story 4

- [ ] T055 [P] [US4] Verify tests/unit/test_agentcore_validation.py tests invalid CPU/memory ratios

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Unit Tests) can proceed first - establishes fast feedback loop
  - User Story 2 (Contract Tests) can proceed after US1 - validates deployments
  - User Story 3 (Integration Tests) should follow US2 - requires deployed infrastructure patterns
  - User Story 4 (Validation Tests) can proceed in parallel with US2/US3 - extends US1
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Unit Tests**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Contract Tests**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but benefits from US1 patterns
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Integration Tests**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but benefits from US2 boto3 patterns
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Validation Tests**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 unit test patterns

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Unit Tests)**:
- Fix JSII conflicts in existing tests (T011-T013) before adding new tests
- New stack validation tests (T014-T017) can run in parallel
- Final validation (T018-T019) depends on all unit tests being fixed

**User Story 2 (Contract Tests)**:
- All test rewrites (T020-T034) can run in parallel - different files
- Contract YAML validation (T035-T038) depends on corresponding test rewrites
- Skip conditions (T039-T040) can be added in parallel across all contract tests
- Final validation (T041) depends on all contract tests being rewritten

**User Story 3 (Integration Tests)**:
- Existing test verification (T042-T046) can run in parallel - different files
- New test creation (T047-T050) can run in parallel - different files
- Skip conditions (T051-T052) can be added after tests exist
- Final validation (T053-T054) depends on all integration tests being complete

**User Story 4 (Validation Tests)**:
- All validation test additions (T055-T059) can run in parallel - same file but different test functions
- Validation checks (T060-T062) depend on all validation tests being added

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks can run in parallel
- T001, T002, T003, T004

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Some parallelism
- T006, T007, T008 depend on T005 (validate pattern works first)
- T009, T010 can run independently

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T011, T012, T013 can run in parallel (different files)
- T014, T015, T016, T017 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: HIGHLY PARALLEL - 15 test rewrites
- T020-T034 can ALL run in parallel (different files)
- T035-T038 can run in parallel after their dependencies
- T039-T040 can run in parallel across all files

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: HIGHLY PARALLEL - 9 test files
- T042-T050 can ALL run in parallel (different files)
- T051-T052 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (User Story 4)**: HIGHLY PARALLEL - validation tests
- T055-T059 can ALL run in parallel (different test functions)

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: Some parallelism
- T063-T066 can run in parallel (GitHub Actions workflow jobs)
- T067, T068, T071, T072 can run in parallel (different files)

Task: "Add IAM policy validation to test_agentcore_execution_role_contract.py"
Task: "Add trust policy validation to test_agentcore_execution_role_contract.py"
Task: "Add VPC endpoint policy validation to test_agentcore_vpc_endpoint_contract.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Fast Feedback Loop)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T010) - CRITICAL for all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T019) - Unit tests only
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/` - should pass in <30s without AWS credentials
5. Developers can now use unit tests during development

### Incremental Delivery (Add Contract Tests)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Unit tests work independently (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Contract tests work independently after deployment
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Deploy stacks, run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/contract/` - validates real infrastructure
5. CI/CD can now validate deployments automatically

### Full Feature Delivery (Add Integration + Validation)

1. Complete User Story 3 ‚Üí Integration tests validate end-to-end behavior
2. Complete User Story 4 ‚Üí Validation tests catch invalid configs early
3. Complete Phase 7 ‚Üí CI/CD integration, documentation, polish
4. **FINAL VALIDATION**: Run all test types, verify success criteria met

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase (T005-T010) completes:

1. **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T011-T019) - Unit test fixes
2. **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T020-T041) - Contract test rewrites (15 files!)
3. **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T042-T054) - Integration test implementation
4. **Developer D**: User Story 4 (T055-T062) - Validation test enhancements

All stories can proceed in parallel since they work on different test categories/files.

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (fast unit tests) - enables developer feedback loop without AWS deployment

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent test functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Current contract tests are MISNAMED - they use `Template.from_stack()` (unit tests) not boto3 (contract tests)
- Major effort is in Phase 4 (User Story 2) - rewriting 15 contract test files to use boto3
- JSII kernel conflicts are already partially fixed in test_agentcore_validation.py - use as reference pattern
- Contract YAML files in specs/008-add-aws-agentcore/contracts/ are source of truth for validation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: running contract/integration tests without deployed infrastructure (should skip gracefully)
