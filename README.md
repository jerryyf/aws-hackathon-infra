# aws-hackathon-infra

Repository for AWS Hackathon AgentCore infrastructure.

> Note on AI-generated content: AI coding agents are used here to accelerate development. However **organic** content (i.e. code/documentation a human wrote) should be clearly tagged - for example in the commit message. Organic content can include AI-enhanced content where sensibly reviewed. Perhaps an opinionated perspective, but it is easier for humans to review organic code than it is to review AI-generated code.

## Prerequisites
- opencode
- access to a model with strong coding capabilities and tool use (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4, OpenAI Codex)
- spec-kit
- aws-cdk

## Guidelines
AGENTS.md should be updated with `/init` frequently. The platform that the agent was run on must be included. Only perform manual edits to documentation.
