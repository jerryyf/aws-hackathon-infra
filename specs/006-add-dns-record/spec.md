# Feature Specification: DNS Record for bidopsai.com

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-dns-record`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add DNS record for bidopsai.com to point to the ALB in CDK NetworkStack"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Map custom domain bidopsai.com to existing public ALB
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users accessing bidopsai.com via web browser
   ‚Üí Actions: DNS resolution, HTTPS access to application
   ‚Üí Data: Domain name bidopsai.com, ALB endpoint
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use existing ALB, HTTPS required for production
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Route53 hosted zone for bidopsai.com assumed to exist
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] SSL/TLS certificate handling required for HTTPS
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User types bidopsai.com and accesses application
   ‚Üí Edge: Certificate validation, DNS propagation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí DNS A record (alias) to ALB
   ‚Üí HTTPS listener with valid SSL certificate
   ‚Üí HTTP to HTTPS redirect
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Domain: bidopsai.com
   ‚Üí DNS Record: A record (alias) pointing to ALB
   ‚Üí SSL Certificate: For bidopsai.com domain validation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details (CDK specifics in plan phase)
   ‚Üí Focus on WHAT (DNS mapping) not HOW (CDK constructs)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an end user, when I navigate to https://bidopsai.com in my web browser, I should be routed to the AWS Hackathon application load balancer so I can access the application using a memorable, branded domain name instead of the AWS-generated ALB DNS name.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a user with internet access, **When** I type "https://bidopsai.com" in my browser, **Then** I should reach the application load balancer and see a valid HTTPS connection with a trusted SSL certificate
2. **Given** I am a user trying to access the application, **When** I type "http://bidopsai.com" (without HTTPS), **Then** I should be automatically redirected to "https://bidopsai.com" with a secure connection
3. **Given** DNS changes have been deployed, **When** I query DNS for bidopsai.com, **Then** the DNS record should resolve to the public ALB endpoint within the TTL period
4. **Given** I access the domain from different geographic locations, **When** I perform DNS lookups, **Then** I should receive consistent DNS responses pointing to the same ALB

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the SSL certificate expires? System must have automated certificate renewal to prevent service disruption
- How does the system handle DNS propagation delays? Users may see inconsistent behavior during the TTL window after DNS changes
- What if the hosted zone for bidopsai.com doesn't exist? Deployment must fail with clear error message indicating missing prerequisite
- What if the ALB is deleted or recreated? DNS record must be updated to point to the new ALB endpoint

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a DNS A record (alias) for bidopsai.com that points to the public Application Load Balancer
- **FR-002**: System MUST provision an SSL/TLS certificate for bidopsai.com to enable HTTPS connections
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate the SSL certificate using DNS validation to prove domain ownership
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure the ALB to accept HTTPS traffic on port 443 using the provisioned certificate
- **FR-005**: System MUST redirect all HTTP traffic (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) with a 301 permanent redirect status code
- **FR-006**: System MUST use the existing Route53 hosted zone for bidopsai.com (prerequisite validation required)
- **FR-007**: System MUST export the DNS record name and certificate ARN as stack outputs for reference by other stacks
- **FR-008**: System MUST support accessing the application via both bidopsai.com and www.bidopsai.com (with www subdomain redirecting to apex domain)

### Key Entities
- **Domain**: bidopsai.com - The primary custom domain name that users will use to access the application
- **DNS A Record**: Alias record type that maps bidopsai.com to the ALB DNS name without exposing the underlying AWS infrastructure
- **SSL Certificate**: Public SSL/TLS certificate issued for bidopsai.com, validated via DNS, enabling encrypted HTTPS connections
- **ALB HTTPS Listener**: Listener configuration on port 443 that terminates SSL and uses the bidopsai.com certificate
- **Route53 Hosted Zone**: DNS zone for bidopsai.com where the A record will be created (must exist as prerequisite)
