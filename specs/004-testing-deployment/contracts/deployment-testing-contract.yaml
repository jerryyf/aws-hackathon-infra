# Deployment Testing Contract

**Feature**: `004-testing-deployment`
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Description**: Contract for deployment testing capabilities including synthesis validation, ordered deployment, post-deployment verification, and rollback procedures

## Test Scenarios

### Synthesis Testing
- **Input**: CDK application with all stacks
- **Process**: Execute `cdk synth` on all stacks
- **Output**: Valid CloudFormation templates without errors
- **Validation**: All templates parse successfully, no unresolved references

### Deployment Order Testing
- **Input**: List of stacks with dependencies
- **Process**: Deploy stacks in dependency order (network → database → storage → compute → monitoring)
- **Output**: All stacks deployed successfully
- **Validation**: Cross-stack references resolve correctly

### Post-Deployment Verification
- **Input**: Deployed AWS resources
- **Process**: Query AWS APIs to verify resource existence and configuration
- **Output**: All resources accessible and properly configured
- **Validation**: Resources match expected properties from contracts

### Rollback Testing
- **Input**: Failed deployment state
- **Process**: Execute rollback procedures
- **Output**: All deployed resources removed
- **Validation**: No orphaned resources remain

## Contract Tests

### Test: CDK Synthesis Success
```python
def test_cdk_synthesis():
    # Execute cdk synth for all stacks
    result = subprocess.run(["cdk", "synth"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
    assert "Synthesis complete" in result.stderr
```

### Test: Stack Deployment Order
```python
def test_deployment_order():
    deployment_order = ["NetworkStack", "DatabaseStack", "StorageStack", "ComputeStack", "MonitoringStack"]
    # Verify each stack can be deployed after its dependencies
    for stack in deployment_order:
        # Mock deployment and verify cross-references
        pass
```

### Test: Resource Accessibility
```python
def test_resource_accessibility():
    # After deployment, verify resources exist and are accessible
    vpc = ec2.describe_vpcs(VpcIds=[vpc_id])
    assert len(vpc['Vpcs']) == 1
    assert vpc['Vpcs'][0]['State'] == 'available'
```

### Test: Rollback Completeness
```python
def test_rollback_completeness():
    # Deploy stacks, then rollback
    # Verify no resources remain
    resources = cloudformation.describe_stacks()
    assert len(resources['Stacks']) == 0
```

## Dependencies
- CDK application with all infrastructure stacks
- AWS credentials with deployment permissions
- Test environment (dev/staging)

## Success Criteria
- All synthesis tests pass
- All deployments complete within 30 minutes
- All post-deployment verifications pass
- Rollback removes all resources cleanly
- Test execution generates comprehensive logs
