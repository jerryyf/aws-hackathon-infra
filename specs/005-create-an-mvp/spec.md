## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer on the AgentCore hackathon team, I need to deploy AI agent runtimes to AWS using infrastructure-as-code so that I can quickly provision production-grade, containerized agent environments without manual AWS console configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Python agent entrypoint file exists, **When** the CDK stack is deployed, **Then** an ECR repository is created, a container image is built and pushed, and an AgentCore Runtime is provisioned with the correct IAM permissions
2. **Given** the AgentCore Runtime is deployed, **When** I invoke the agent with a prompt, **Then** the agent processes the request and returns a response within acceptable latency
3. **Given** deployment configuration changes are made, **When** I redeploy the CDK stack, **Then** the infrastructure updates without data loss and with zero downtime for existing sessions
4. **Given** the agent runtime is running, **When** I check CloudWatch Logs, **Then** I can view agent invocation logs, errors, and performance metrics
5. **Given** authentication is configured, **When** an unauthorized request is made, **Then** the request is rejected with appropriate error messaging

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the container build fails during deployment?
- How does the system handle agent runtime crashes or timeouts?
- What happens when the IAM execution role lacks required permissions?
- How does the system handle concurrent invocations exceeding runtime capacity?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Infrastructure Provisioning**
- **FR-001**: System MUST create an Amazon ECR repository for storing agent container images
- **FR-002**: System MUST provision an IAM execution role with permissions for Bedrock AgentCore, CloudWatch Logs, and ECR access
- **FR-003**: System MUST create an AgentCore Runtime resource with the specified container URI
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure network settings for VPC-based deployment in existing private subnets
- **FR-005**: System MUST tag all AWS resources with Project, Environment, Owner, and CostCenter tags per constitution requirements

**Container Management**
- **FR-006**: System MUST build Docker images for linux/arm64 architecture (AgentCore requirement)
- **FR-007**: System MUST push container images to ECR with immutable tags
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable ECR image scanning on push for vulnerability detection
- **FR-009**: System MUST configure the AgentCore Runtime to pull from the ECR repository
- **FR-010**: System MUST support container image updates via CDK stack updates

**Agent Configuration**
- **FR-011**: System MUST accept a Python entrypoint file path as configuration
- **FR-012**: System MUST support environment variable injection into the runtime (e.g., API keys, model IDs)
- **FR-013**: System MUST configure agent runtime using AWS Strands framework
- **FR-014**: System MUST support requirements.txt for Python dependencies
- **FR-015**: System MUST expose /invocations endpoint for agent requests
- **FR-016**: System MUST expose /ping endpoint for health checks

**Authentication & Authorization**
- **FR-017**: System MUST configure inbound authentication via Amazon Cognito User Pool
- **FR-018**: System MUST support JWT bearer token validation using Cognito-issued tokens
- **FR-019**: System MUST reject unauthenticated requests with 401 status codes
- **FR-020**: System MUST apply least-privilege IAM policies per constitution security requirements

**Observability**
- **FR-021**: System MUST send agent logs to CloudWatch Logs with structured JSON formatting
- **FR-022**: System MUST create CloudWatch alarms for runtime failures and error rates
- **FR-023**: System MUST log invocation metadata (session ID, latency, payload size) to CloudWatch
- **FR-024**: System MUST expose runtime status via AgentCore control plane APIs
- **FR-025**: System MUST retain CloudWatch Logs for minimum 30 days per compliance requirements

**Deployment & Operations**
- **FR-026**: System MUST support `cdk deploy` for initial provisioning and updates
- **FR-027**: System MUST support `cdk destroy` for cleanup without manual resource deletion
- **FR-028**: System MUST provide stack outputs with AgentCore Runtime ARN and invocation endpoint
- **FR-029**: System MUST support multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, production) via CDK context
- **FR-030**: System MUST implement rollback capability for failed deployments

**Security & Compliance**
- **FR-031**: System MUST encrypt ECR images at rest using AWS-managed KMS keys
- **FR-032**: System MUST store secrets (API keys, credentials) in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store SecureString
- **FR-033**: System MUST enable CloudTrail logging for AgentCore API calls
- **FR-034**: System MUST apply security group rules restricting inbound traffic to ALB only for VPC-based deployment
- **FR-035**: System MUST comply with AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar per constitution

**Memory & State Management**
- **FR-036**: System MUST support stateless HTTP invocations with independent request handling
- **FR-037**: System MUST provide session management via runtime session IDs (33+ characters) for request tracking

### Key Entities

- **AgentRuntime**: The deployed container-based runtime hosting the AI agent, managed by Bedrock AgentCore control plane, with attributes including ARN, name, status, container URI, and network configuration
- **Container**: Docker image stored in ECR containing the agent code, Strands framework dependencies, and FastAPI/uvicorn server, built for ARM64 architecture
- **ExecutionRole**: IAM role assumed by the AgentCore Runtime with permissions for CloudWatch, Bedrock models, ECR, and any external service integrations (e.g., S3, DynamoDB)
- **EcrRepository**: Container registry for versioned agent images, with image scanning, lifecycle policies, and encryption enabled
- **AuthorizerConfiguration**: Authentication settings for inbound requests, potentially including Cognito User Pool ID, discovery URL, and allowed client IDs
- **RuntimeEndpoint**: Invocation URL for the deployed agent, supporting /invocations POST requests with JSON payloads
- **EnvironmentVariables**: Key-value pairs injected into the container runtime (e.g., MODEL_ID, MEMORY_ID, API keys) sourced from Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
