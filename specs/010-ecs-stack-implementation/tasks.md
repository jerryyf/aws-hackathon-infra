# Tasks: ECS Stack Infrastructure for 2-Service Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-ecs-stack-implementation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Architecture**: 2-tier system with BFF (public ALB) ‚Üí AgentCore (Service Discovery, private)

**Tests**: Test tasks are OPTIONAL and not included per project standards (only generate if explicitly requested).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Infrastructure: `cdk/stacks/`, `cdk/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/contract/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Cluster): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (Task Definitions): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 4 (Security Groups): Can start after Foundational - Validates security groups created in Phase 2
  - User Story 3 (Services): Depends on User Story 1 (cluster) and User Story 2 (task definitions) completion
  - User Story 5 (IAM Roles): Can start after Foundational - Refines task roles created in Phase 2
- **Observability (Phase 8)**: Depends on User Story 3 (services created)
- **Stack Integration (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all implementation being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Validates security groups created in Phase 2
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 and User Story 2 completion
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Refines task roles

### Within Each User Story

- Task roles before task definitions
- Security groups before services
- Task definitions before services
- Target groups before services
- Services before auto-scaling policies
- Implementation before contract tests

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- User Story 1, User Story 2, and User Story 4 can start in parallel after Foundational phase
- All task role creation tasks (T018, T019) can run in parallel
- All CloudWatch log group creation tasks (T020, T021) can run in parallel
- All security group contract tests (T027-T029) can run in parallel
- All service auto-scaling configuration tasks (T035, T036) can run in parallel
- All CloudWatch alarm creation tasks (T045-T047) can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks (T064, T065) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all task role creation tasks together:
Task: "Create BFF task role with CloudWatch Logs write and SSM Parameter Store read permissions"
Task: "Create AgentCore task role with full Bedrock agent access, S3 read/write, and SSM Parameter Store read permissions"

# Launch all CloudWatch log group creation tasks together:
Task: "Create CloudWatch log group for BFF service with 7-day retention"

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (ECS Cluster)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Task Definitions)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Deploy cluster and task definitions, validate via `aws ecs describe-clusters` and `aws ecs describe-task-definition`

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Cluster) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP infrastructure ready
3. Add User Story 2 (Task Definitions) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Tasks defined
4. Add User Story 4 (Security Groups) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Network isolation validated
5. Add User Story 3 (Services) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Services running with ALB integration
6. Add User Story 5 (IAM Roles) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Least-privilege access validated

   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Security Groups)
3. After US1 & US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Services)
4. After Foundational:
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (IAM Roles)
5. After US3 completes:
   - Developer C: Observability (Phase 8)
6. After all user stories:
   - Developer A: Stack Integration (Phase 9)
   - Developer B: Polish (Phase 10)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Contract tests validate CloudFormation outputs match expectations
- Unit tests verify CDK resource configuration before deployment
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
