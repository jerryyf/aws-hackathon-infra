# Compute Stack Deployment Report

Timestamp: 2025-10-09 00:30:00 UTC
Stack: ComputeStack

Key resources
-------------
- ECS Cluster: `hackathon-cluster`
- Fargate task definition: CPU 256, Memory 512
- Placeholder container: `nginx:latest` (AppContainer)

Important file/artifact
-----------------------
- Synth template: `cdk/cdk.out/ComputeStack.template.json`

Sanity checks (Console)
-----------------------
- ECS Console: Cluster exists and has correct VPC/subnets.
- Task Definitions: TaskDefinition present with container definitions.
- Verify any service (if created later) can be placed on the cluster and runs within `PrivateApp` subnets.

Next steps
----------
- Replace placeholder container with application image from `ECR` (see StorageStack ECR repository).
- Create ECS Service and ALB target groups to route traffic to the tasks if needed.
