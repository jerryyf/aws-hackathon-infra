# Tasks: 004-testing-deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-testing-deployment/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume CDK project structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Configure testing environment and dependencies for deployment testing
- [ ] T002 [P] Set up logging infrastructure for deployment tracking

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T003 [P] Contract test for deployment-testing-contract.yaml in tests/contract/test_deployment_testing_contract.py
- [ ] T004 [P] Integration test CDK synthesis success in tests/integration/test_cdk_synthesis.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Integration test stack deployment order in tests/integration/test_deployment_order.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test post-deployment verification in tests/integration/test_post_deployment_verification.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test rollback completeness in tests/integration/test_rollback_completeness.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T008 [P] Deployment model in cdk/models/deployment.py
- [ ] T009 [P] Stack model in cdk/models/stack.py
- [ ] T010 [P] Resource model in cdk/models/resource.py
- [ ] T011 Implement synthesis testing logic in scripts/test_synthesis.py
- [ ] T012 Implement deployment order validation in scripts/test_deployment_order.py
- [ ] T013 Implement post-deployment verification in scripts/test_post_deployment.py
- [ ] T014 Implement rollback testing in scripts/test_rollback.py

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T015 Integrate boto3 for AWS resource validation
- [ ] T016 Add comprehensive logging to deployment and rollback scripts
- [ ] T017 Add error handling and retry logic to testing scripts
- [ ] T018 Environment-specific configuration for test deployments

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for model classes in tests/unit/test_models.py
- [ ] T020 Performance validation for deployment scripts (<30 minutes)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update documentation for deployment testing in docs/deployment-testing.md
- [ ] T022 Run quickstart.md scenarios manually

## Dependencies
- Tests (T003-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008-T010 blocks T011-T014
- T011-T014 blocks T015-T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T022)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T003-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test for deployment-testing-contract.yaml in tests/contract/test_deployment_testing_contract.py"
Task: "Integration test CDK synthesis success in tests/integration/test_cdk_synthesis.py"
Task: "Integration test stack deployment order in tests/integration/test_deployment_order.py"
Task: "Integration test post-deployment verification in tests/integration/test_post_deployment_verification.py"
Task: "Integration test rollback completeness in tests/integration/test_rollback_completeness.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
