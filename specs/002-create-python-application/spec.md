## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What level of AWS Shield protection is required for the public ALB? ‚Üí A: Shield Standard (basic DDoS protection included with CloudFront/ALB)

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: What are the acceptable recovery objectives for database failover? ‚Üí A: RPO 15 minutes / RTO 30 minutes (looser requirements, simpler for PoC)
- Q: Which encryption approach should be used for S3 buckets? ‚Üí A: AWS managed KMS keys (simpler, secure, AWS handles rotation)
- Q: What level of WAF protection is needed for the public ALB? ‚Üí A: AWS Managed Rules for common threats (SQL injection, XSS) + rate limiting
- Q: What retention period meets audit requirements for CloudTrail logs? ‚Üí A: 7 years (AWS compliance standard, meets most regulatory requirements)
- Q: Which parameters should be configurable across environments? ‚Üí A: Environment name, region, CIDR blocks, instance sizes (common deployment parameters)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Platform operators need to provision a complete AWS infrastructure foundation for running Bedrock agents in a production-ready, secure, and highly-available environment. The infrastructure must support multi-tier application architecture with frontend (BFF), backend (GraphQL), and agent runtime components, all isolated within private subnets with controlled access to AWS managed services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing infrastructure, **When** infrastructure is provisioned, **Then** a multi-AZ VPC with public and private subnets is created across us-east-1a and us-east-1b
2. **Given** the VPC is created, **When** services are deployed, **Then** all private subnets can access AWS managed services (Bedrock, S3, Secrets Manager) through VPC endpoints without internet access
3. **Given** infrastructure is provisioned, **When** validating network topology, **Then** public subnets contain load balancers and NAT gateways while application components reside in private subnets
4. **Given** infrastructure is running, **When** checking high availability, **Then** each service tier has resources distributed across both availability zones
5. **Given** infrastructure exists, **When** services need database access, **Then** RDS proxy endpoints are available in both AZs with automatic failover capability
6. **Given** infrastructure is provisioned, **When** checking security posture, **Then** no private resources have direct internet access and all secrets are stored in Secrets Manager
7. **Given** the platform is operational, **When** deploying containerized workloads, **Then** ECR repositories are available with image scanning enabled
8. **Given** infrastructure is deployed, **When** monitoring is required, **Then** CloudWatch and CloudTrail are configured to capture logs, metrics, and API audit trails

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one availability zone becomes unavailable? (System must continue operating from the remaining AZ)
- How does the system handle VPC endpoint failures? (VPC endpoints are highly available AWS managed services; no fallback mechanism required for PoC scope)
- What occurs if RDS primary fails? (RDS Proxy must automatically route to standby replica)
- How are infrastructure changes tracked and audited? (CloudTrail must log all infrastructure modifications)
- What happens when secret rotation occurs? (Applications must seamlessly retrieve updated secrets; manual rotation for PoC, automated rotation recommended for production)
