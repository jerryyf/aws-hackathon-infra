# Feature Specification: Implement deployment testing capabilities for the AWS CDK infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `004-testing-deployment`
**Created**: Wed Oct 08 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement deployment testing capabilities for the AWS CDK infrastructure"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer deploying AWS CDK infrastructure, I want comprehensive testing capabilities so that I can verify the infrastructure deploys correctly, resources are accessible, and the system functions as expected before production deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** CDK stacks are defined, **When** I run synthesis tests, **Then** all stacks generate valid CloudFormation templates without errors.
2. **Given** infrastructure is ready for deployment, **When** I execute deployment scripts, **Then** all stacks deploy successfully in the correct order.
3. **Given** infrastructure has been deployed, **When** I run post-deployment tests, **Then** all resources are accessible and configured correctly.
4. **Given** a deployment fails, **When** I execute rollback, **Then** all deployed resources are cleanly removed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when CDK synthesis fails due to invalid stack configuration?
- How does system handle partial deployment failures (some stacks succeed, others fail)?
- What happens when AWS service limits are exceeded during deployment?
- How does system handle network connectivity issues during deployment verification?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST synthesize all CDK stacks without errors during testing
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate CloudFormation template outputs for cross-stack references
- **FR-003**: System MUST deploy stacks in dependency order (network before compute before monitoring)
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify post-deployment resource accessibility and configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide automated rollback capability for failed deployments
- **FR-006**: System MUST log deployment progress and status for monitoring
- **FR-007**: System MUST support test environment deployments separate from production

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Deployment**: Represents a CDK deployment operation, with attributes for status, timestamp, and stack order
- **Stack**: Represents a CDK stack, with attributes for name, dependencies, and outputs
- **Resource**: Represents AWS resources created by stacks, with attributes for type, accessibility, and configuration
