## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Platform operators need to provision a complete AWS infrastructure foundation for running Bedrock agents in a production-ready, secure, and highly-available environment. The infrastructure must support multi-tier application architecture with frontend (BFF), backend (GraphQL), and agent runtime components, all isolated within private subnets with controlled access to AWS managed services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing infrastructure, **When** infrastructure is provisioned, **Then** a multi-AZ VPC with public and private subnets is created across us-east-1a and us-east-1b
2. **Given** the VPC is created, **When** services are deployed, **Then** all private subnets can access AWS managed services (Bedrock, S3, Secrets Manager) through VPC endpoints without internet access
3. **Given** infrastructure is provisioned, **When** validating network topology, **Then** public subnets contain load balancers and NAT gateways while application components reside in private subnets
4. **Given** infrastructure is running, **When** checking high availability, **Then** each service tier has resources distributed across both availability zones
5. **Given** infrastructure exists, **When** services need database access, **Then** RDS proxy endpoints are available in both AZs with automatic failover capability
6. **Given** infrastructure is provisioned, **When** checking security posture, **Then** no private resources have direct internet access and all secrets are stored in Secrets Manager
7. **Given** the platform is operational, **When** deploying containerized workloads, **Then** ECR repositories are available with image scanning enabled
8. **Given** infrastructure is deployed, **When** monitoring is required, **Then** CloudWatch and CloudTrail are configured to capture logs, metrics, and API audit trails

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one availability zone becomes unavailable? (System must continue operating from the remaining AZ)
- How does the system handle VPC endpoint failures? (Must validate endpoint health and provide fallback mechanisms [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback strategy not specified])
- What occurs if RDS primary fails? (RDS Proxy must automatically route to standby replica)
- How are infrastructure changes tracked and audited? (CloudTrail must log all infrastructure modifications)
- What happens when secret rotation occurs? (Applications must seamlessly retrieve updated secrets [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rotation automation scope not specified])
