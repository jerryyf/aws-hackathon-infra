# AWS Hackathon Infrastructure Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AWS Well-Architected Framework (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All infrastructure and application designs MUST align with the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

- **Operational Excellence**: Automate changes, respond to events, define standards for workload management
- **Security**: Protect data, systems, and assets through defense-in-depth strategies
- **Reliability**: Design for failure recovery, test recovery procedures, scale horizontally
- **Performance Efficiency**: Use compute resources efficiently, experiment with new services
- **Cost Optimization**: Understand spending, select appropriate resources, scale based on demand
- **Sustainability**: Minimize environmental impact, maximize resource utilization

**Rationale**: AWS Well-Architected Framework ensures best practices are embedded from inception, reducing technical debt and operational risk while maximizing cloud value.

### II. Infrastructure as Code Excellence
All AWS infrastructure MUST be defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CDK (preferred) or Terraform:

- Every resource MUST be version controlled and peer reviewed
- Manual console changes are PROHIBITED except for emergency triage (must be back-ported to IaC within 24 hours)
- IaC MUST be modular, reusable, and environment-agnostic
- State management MUST be centralized and secured (S3 + DynamoDB for Terraform, CDK defaults)
- Secrets and credentials MUST NEVER be hardcoded (use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store)

**Rationale**: IaC ensures reproducibility, auditability, and eliminates configuration drift. Code review catches security issues before deployment.

### III. Security & Compliance First
Security is a foundational requirement, not an afterthought:

- **Least Privilege**: All IAM policies MUST grant minimum required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls (network, application, data)
- **Encryption**: Data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+ only)
- **Audit Trail**: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and access logs MUST be enabled
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store (SecureString) MUST be used
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Container images and dependencies MUST be scanned before deployment
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnets for compute, VPC endpoints for AWS services, no public internet access unless justified

**Rationale**: Security breaches are costly and damage trust. Building security into every layer from the start is non-negotiable.

### IV. Code Quality & Maintainability
Code MUST meet professional standards and be maintainable by any team member:

- **Linting & Formatting**: Automated linting enforced in CI/CD (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing MUST be used where available (TypeScript over JavaScript, type hints in Python)
- **Documentation**: Public APIs MUST have inline documentation; complex logic MUST have explanatory comments
- **Testing Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for core business logic
- **Code Review**: All changes MUST be peer reviewed before merge
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns in the codebase; deviations require justification

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, accelerates onboarding, and makes the system more maintainable over time.

### V. Extensibility & Modularity
Design systems to be extensible and composable:

- **Microservices Patterns**: Services MUST be loosely coupled with well-defined interfaces
- **API-First Design**: Internal services MUST expose APIs (REST/GraphQL) before building consumers
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use EventBridge, SNS/SQS for asynchronous communication where appropriate
- **Plugin Architecture**: Features SHOULD support extension without core modification
- **Version Compatibility**: Breaking changes MUST include migration paths and deprecation notices

**Rationale**: Extensible systems adapt to changing requirements without major rewrites, reducing long-term maintenance cost.

### VI. Observability & Operational Excellence
Systems MUST be observable and debuggable in production:

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs, sent to CloudWatch Logs
- **Distributed Tracing**: AWS X-Ray MUST be enabled for request tracing across services
- **Metrics & Alarms**: CloudWatch metrics and alarms for key performance indicators (latency, error rate, saturation)
- **Health Checks**: All services MUST expose health check endpoints
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures documented for common failure scenarios
- **Chaos Engineering**: Failure injection testing in non-production environments

**Rationale**: You cannot fix what you cannot see. Observability enables rapid incident response and continuous improvement.

## AWS-Specific Standards

### Multi-Region & High Availability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Production workloads MUST span at least 2 Availability Zones
- **Data Replication**: Critical data MUST have automated backup and cross-region replication strategies
- **Disaster Recovery**: RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) MUST be defined and tested quarterly

### Service Selection Criteria
- **Managed Services First**: Prefer AWS managed services over self-managed (RDS over EC2 database, Fargate over EC2)
- **Right-Sizing**: Resources MUST be sized based on actual metrics, not guesswork
- **Serverless Consideration**: Evaluate Lambda, Fargate, or container-based solutions before provisioning servers

### Cost Management
- **Tagging Strategy**: All resources MUST be tagged with: Project, Environment, Owner, CostCenter
- **Budget Alerts**: AWS Budgets MUST be configured with alerts at 80% and 100% thresholds
- **Reserved Capacity**: Long-running resources MUST use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans

## Development Standards

### Branching & Deployment Strategy
- **Git Flow**: Feature branches → Pull Request → Code Review → Main branch → Automated deployment
- **Environment Progression**: Dev → Staging → Production (no skipping)
- **Rollback Plan**: Every deployment MUST have a documented rollback procedure

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and contract tests MUST pass before deployment
- **Security Scanning**: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency scanning required
- **Infrastructure Validation**: CDK/Terraform plan MUST be reviewed before apply
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments for user-facing services

### Testing Gates
- **Contract Testing**: APIs MUST have contract tests validating request/response schemas
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-service interactions MUST be tested in staging environment
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing required for services expecting >1000 req/min
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing required before production launch

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and architectural decisions. Any deviation MUST be:

1. **Documented**: Explain why the deviation is necessary in ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format
2. **Approved**: Reviewed and approved by at least two senior engineers
3. **Time-Boxed**: Deviations MUST include a plan to return to constitutional compliance

### Amendment Process
- Amendments require consensus among core team members
- Breaking changes require MAJOR version bump
- All amendments MUST include migration plan for existing systems
- Constitutional changes MUST be propagated to all template files within 48 hours

### Compliance Review
- **Pre-Deployment**: Constitution check MUST pass before any feature moves to implementation
- **Architecture Review**: New services MUST undergo architecture review against these principles
- **Quarterly Audit**: Codebase audited quarterly for constitutional compliance
- **Continuous Education**: Team training on AWS Well-Architected Framework quarterly

### Enforcement
- Pull requests violating these principles MUST be blocked
- Production deployments violating security or reliability principles MUST be rolled back immediately
- Unjustified complexity MUST be refactored before feature completion

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-03 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-03
