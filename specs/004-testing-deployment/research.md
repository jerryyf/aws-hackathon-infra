# Research Findings: Deployment Testing for AWS CDK Infrastructure

## Decision: Use CDK Assertions + Pytest for Contract Testing
**Rationale**: CDK provides built-in assertions for validating CloudFormation templates without deployment. Pytest offers familiar testing framework with fixtures for CDK apps.
**Alternatives considered**: Manual CloudFormation validation (too slow), custom assertion libraries (unnecessary complexity), deployment-based testing only (expensive and slow).

## Decision: Integration Testing with Boto3 Resource Validation
**Rationale**: After deployment, use boto3 to verify resource existence, configuration, and accessibility. This validates actual AWS state rather than just templates.
**Alternatives considered**: CloudFormation describe-stacks only (misses runtime configuration), custom AWS CLI scripts (not reusable), third-party tools like AWS Config (overkill for deployment testing).

## Decision: Ordered Deployment Testing with Dependency Validation
**Rationale**: Test stack deployment in dependency order (network → database → compute → monitoring) with cross-stack reference validation.
**Alternatives considered**: Parallel deployment testing (risks missing dependency issues), single-stack testing (misses integration problems).

## Decision: Rollback Testing with Resource Cleanup Validation
**Rationale**: Implement automated rollback procedures that verify complete resource removal. Use CDK destroy with timeout and retry logic.
**Alternatives considered**: Manual rollback (error-prone), partial cleanup (leaves orphaned resources), no rollback testing (production risk).

## Decision: Logging and Monitoring Integration in Tests
**Rationale**: Tests should validate that CloudWatch logs, metrics, and alarms are properly configured and accessible post-deployment.
**Alternatives considered**: Separate monitoring testing (misses deployment integration), no monitoring validation (operational blind spots).

## Decision: Multi-Environment Testing Strategy
**Rationale**: Test deployments in dev/staging environments before production. Use environment-specific configurations and resource tagging.
**Alternatives considered**: Production-only testing (too risky), single environment (misses environment-specific issues).

## Key Findings
- CDK synth validation catches template errors early
- Contract tests prevent regression in stack outputs
- Integration tests require careful resource cleanup to avoid costs
- Rollback testing needs timeout handling for large stacks
- AWS service limits must be considered in test environments
