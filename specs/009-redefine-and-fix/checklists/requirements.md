# Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: `009-redefine-and-fix`  
**Checklist Type**: Requirements Validation  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and measurability of test suite reorganization requirements

---

## Instructions

This checklist validates the **quality of requirements**, not implementation. Review each item to ensure requirements are clear, complete, consistent, and measurable before starting development.

**Review Frequency**: 
- Initial review before starting development
- Re-review when scope changes or new requirements emerge
- Final review before marking feature complete

**Pass Criteria**: All items must be checked (✓) before proceeding to implementation

---

## 1. Completeness

### 1.1 Test Categorization Requirements
- [x] **Clear definition of unit tests**: Requirements specify what unit tests validate (CloudFormation templates), what tools they use (`Template.from_stack()`), and what they must NOT require (AWS credentials, deployed resources) → FR-001
- [x] **Clear definition of contract tests**: Requirements specify what contract tests validate (deployed CloudFormation outputs, AWS resources), what tools they use (boto3), and what they require (deployed stacks) → FR-002
- [x] **Clear definition of integration tests**: Requirements specify what integration tests validate (end-to-end behavior), what operations they perform (invocations, connections, failover), and dependencies (deployed infrastructure) → FR-003
- [x] **Validation test requirements**: Requirements define input validation tests, error conditions to test, and expected failure modes → US4, FR-008

### 1.2 Test Organization Requirements
- [x] **Directory structure**: Requirements specify where each test type is stored (`tests/unit/`, `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`) → FR-010
- [x] **Naming conventions**: Requirements define test file naming patterns (`test_*.py`) and descriptive test function names → FR-010, FR-011
- [x] **Test discovery**: Requirements specify how pytest discovers tests and any configuration needed → Assumptions

### 1.3 Technical Requirements
- [x] **JSII conflict prevention**: Requirements specify how to prevent construct ID conflicts (UUID suffix pattern, unique stack names) → FR-004
- [x] **AWS credentials handling**: Requirements define which test types require AWS credentials and which must work without them → FR-001, FR-002
- [x] **Stack dependency handling**: Requirements specify how tests handle missing deployed stacks (skip vs fail, error messages) → FR-007
- [x] **Parallel execution**: Requirements address concurrent test execution and race condition prevention → FR-004, SC-006

### 1.4 Contract Validation Requirements
- [x] **Contract source of truth**: Requirements identify contract YAML files as source of truth for validation → FR-006, Assumptions
- [x] **Output validation**: Requirements specify all CloudFormation outputs that must be validated → FR-006
- [x] **Resource property validation**: Requirements define which AWS resource properties must match contracts → FR-002
- [x] **Error handling**: Requirements specify error messages when deployed resources don't match contracts → FR-007

---

## 2. Clarity

### 2.1 Terminology Consistency
- [x] **Unit test definition**: Term "unit test" is used consistently to mean CloudFormation template validation (not AWS resource validation) → FR-001, US1
- [x] **Contract test definition**: Term "contract test" consistently means validating deployed resources against contract specifications → FR-002, US2
- [x] **Test fixture definition**: Term "test fixture" consistently refers to pytest fixtures creating stacks or AWS clients → Key Entities
- [x] **No ambiguous terms**: Requirements avoid ambiguous phrases like "validate infrastructure" without specifying template vs deployed resources → Clear distinction throughout

### 2.2 Scope Boundaries
- [x] **Unit test scope clear**: Requirements clearly state unit tests validate templates only, not deployed resources → FR-001
- [x] **Contract test scope clear**: Requirements clearly distinguish between contract tests (query existing resources) and integration tests (perform operations) → US2 vs US3
- [x] **Integration test scope clear**: Requirements specify integration tests test behavior across multiple services, not just resource existence → FR-003

### 2.3 Requirement Precision
- [x] **Specific tools identified**: Requirements name specific tools (`Template.from_stack()`, boto3, pytest) rather than generic "testing tools" → FR-001, FR-002
- [x] **Specific operations defined**: Requirements specify exact operations (query CloudFormation outputs, describe VPC, invoke agent) not vague "test functionality" → FR-002, FR-003, US2, US3
- [x] **Specific error conditions**: Requirements identify specific failure modes (JSII conflicts, missing credentials, missing stacks) not generic "handle errors" → Edge Cases, FR-004, FR-007

---

## 3. Consistency

### 3.1 Cross-Requirement Alignment
- [x] **User stories align with functional requirements**: Each user story has corresponding functional requirements (US1→FR-001/FR-010, US2→FR-002/FR-006/FR-007, US3→FR-003/FR-009) ✅
- [x] **Success criteria match functional requirements**: Each functional requirement has measurable success criteria (FR-001→SC-001, FR-002→SC-007, FR-004→SC-004/SC-006) ✅
- [x] **Edge cases covered in requirements**: JSII conflicts, missing credentials, missing stacks from edge cases have corresponding functional requirements (JSII→FR-004, credentials→FR-001, stacks→FR-007) ✅
- [x] **Assumptions support requirements**: Assumptions about test execution order, AWS credentials, pytest discovery align with functional requirements ✅

### 3.2 Terminology Consistency
- [x] **Test types named consistently**: Same terms (unit/contract/integration) used across user stories, requirements, success criteria ✅
- [x] **Tool names consistent**: AWS services and tools (CloudFormation, boto3, pytest, JSII) spelled and capitalized consistently ✅
- [x] **Stack naming consistent**: Stack names in requirements match actual stack names in codebase (NetworkStack, AgentCoreStack, etc.) ✅

### 3.3 Priority Consistency
- [x] **Priorities match dependencies**: P1 unit tests don't depend on P2 contract tests; P3 validation tests can wait until P1 works ✅
- [x] **"Why this priority" justifies ranking**: Explanations for P1/P2/P3 align with actual execution dependencies and business value ✅
- [x] **Independent test criteria realistic**: Each user story's "Independent Test" section describes achievable standalone validation ✅

- [x] **False positive rate measurable**: SC-007 specifies "zero false positives" with clear definition (contract tests must actually query deployed resources) ✅

### 4.3 Coverage Requirements
- [x] **Test coverage scope defined**: Requirements specify which stacks need tests (all AgentCore stacks: network, security, storage, database, compute, monitoring, agentcore) ✅
