## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **C1** | Underspecification | **CRITICAL** | cdk/app.py:20-25 | Stack cross-references missing - stacks created without passing dependencies | Add `network_stack=network_stack` to DatabaseStack, ComputeStack, MonitoringStack constructors |
| **C2** | Underspecification | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py:18,27,36 | S3 bucket names hardcoded without account/region prefix - will fail on deployment due to global naming conflict | Use auto-generated names with `bucket_name=None` or add account ID prefix |
| **C3** | Constitution Violation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py:19,28,37 | S3 buckets use S3_MANAGED encryption instead of KMS as mandated by FR-023 and Constitution III | Change to `encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED` |
| **C4** | Missing Implementation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/network_stack.py | Internal ALB required by FR-011 not implemented | Add internal ALB construct |
| **C5** | Missing Implementation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/network_stack.py:103 | Bedrock VPC endpoint uses custom service name without proper validation - will fail on deployment | Use proper InterfaceVpcEndpointAwsService or validate service name exists |
| **C6** | Missing Implementation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/network_stack.py:69-78 | WAF WebACL has no rules - FR-013 requires AWS Managed Rules for SQL injection, XSS, and rate limiting | Add ManagedRuleGroupStatementProperty with AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet |
| **C7** | Constitution Violation | **CRITICAL** | plan.md:284-286 | Phase 2 marked complete but tasks.md shows all tasks completed - violates TDD workflow (implementation should not precede /implement command) | User must verify implementation order or reset to proper state |
| **C8** | Missing Configuration | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/monitoring_stack.py:54 | CloudTrail requires logs_bucket parameter but app.py doesn't pass it | Pass storage_stack.logs_bucket to MonitoringStack |
| **C9** | Constitution Violation | **CRITICAL** | No .gitignore for cdk.context.json, cdk.out/ | Infrastructure state files may leak AWS account metadata | Add cdk.out/, cdk.context.json to .gitignore |
| **C10** | Missing Implementation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/network_stack.py:88-92 | Shield Advanced Protection configured but requires subscription (costly, not mentioned in spec clarifications) | Use Shield Standard (automatic) per spec clarification 2025-10-03 or remove CfnProtection |
| **C11** | Missing Implementation | **CRITICAL** | cdk/stacks/network_stack.py | Missing Route 53 hosted zone (FR-039) and ACM certificate (FR-040) despite outputs defined | Implement Route53 HostedZone and ACM Certificate resources |
| **H1** | Inconsistency | **HIGH** | cdk/app.py:28-32 | Stack dependencies incomplete - database_stack, compute_stack depend on network but not on each other despite cross-references | Add compute_stack.add_dependency(database_stack) for RDS connection |
| **H2** | Contract Violation | **HIGH** | tests/contract/test_ecr_repositories_contract.py:34 | ECR repository contract requires ImageTagMutability=IMMUTABLE (FR-028) but storage_stack.py doesn't set it | Add `image_tag_mutability=ecr.TagMutability.IMMUTABLE` to ECR repository |
| **H3** | Contract Violation | **HIGH** | tests/contract/test_rds_endpoint_contract.py | RDS cluster contract test expects Multi-AZ but deprecated instanceProps API may not guarantee proper distribution | Update to use `writer` and `readers` properties per CDK v2 API |
| **H4** | Ambiguity | **HIGH** | cdk/stacks/database_stack.py:18-25 | Fallback VPC creation for testing bypasses actual VPC dependency - will deploy broken infrastructure if network_stack missing | Remove fallback logic or add strict validation that network_stack must exist |
| **H5** | Missing Implementation | **HIGH** | FR-006, FR-007, FR-033 | NAT gateways, internet gateway, and Route 53/ACM not explicitly configured despite VPC Construct defaults | Validate VPC construct auto-creates required resources or implement explicitly |
| **H6** | Constitution Violation | **HIGH** | No CI/CD pipeline | Constitution §Development Standards requires automated testing in CI/CD before deployment - no GitHub Actions workflow exists | Create .github/workflows/cdk-validate.yml with synth + test |
| **H7** | Constitution Violation | **HIGH** | No tagging strategy | Constitution §Cost Management requires Project, Environment, Owner, CostCenter tags on all resources | Add `Tags.of(scope).add()` calls in app.py |

## Constitution Alignment Issues

### Constitution I: AWS Well-Architected Framework
- ⚠️ **Security**: WAF has no rules (violates defense-in-depth), S3 uses wrong encryption
- ⚠️ **Reliability**: No chaos/failover testing implemented
- ⚠️ **Cost Optimization**: No tagging strategy, Shield Advanced may incur unexpected costs

### Constitution II: Infrastructure as Code Excellence
- ❌ **Secrets Management**: PARTIAL - DB secrets in Secrets Manager ✅, but S3 buckets not using KMS ❌
- ❌ **Environment-Agnostic**: Hardcoded bucket names, regions, instance types

### Constitution III: Security & Compliance First
- ❌ **Encryption**: S3 buckets use S3-managed keys instead of KMS (Critical violation)
- ⚠️ **Network Isolation**: VPC endpoints partially configured, Bedrock endpoint broken

### Constitution IV: Code Quality & Maintainability
- ⚠️ **Type Safety**: Missing on __init__ methods
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: No docstrings on stacks
- ❌ **Testing Coverage**: Contract tests exist but 2 failing, no integration test execution

### Constitution VI: Observability & Operational Excellence
- ❌ **Runbooks**: Quickstart.md not validated (tasks.md T047 marked done but no evidence)
- ⚠️ **Metrics & Alarms**: CloudWatch alarms reference non-existent resources

---

## Unmapped Tasks

All 48 tasks in tasks.md are mapped to requirements. However, **verification tasks (T047, T048) marked complete without evidence**:
- T047: "Run quickstart.md validation scenarios" - No quickstart.md validation section exists
- T048: "Final linting and code cleanup" - Deprecation warnings remain

---

## Remediation Examples

### Fix stack cross-references (C1):
```python
# cdk/app.py line 21-25
database_stack = DatabaseStack(app, "DatabaseStack", env=env, network_stack=network_stack)
compute_stack = ComputeStack(app, "ComputeStack", env=env, network_stack=network_stack)
monitoring_stack = MonitoringStack(app, "MonitoringStack", env=env, logs_bucket=storage_stack.logs_bucket)
```

### Fix S3 bucket names (C2) and encryption (C3):
```python
# cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py - remove bucket_name parameters entirely
self.knowledge_base_bucket = s3.Bucket(
    self, "KnowledgeBaseBucket",
    # bucket_name="hackathon-knowledge-base",  # REMOVE THIS LINE
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED,  # Fix C3
    versioned=True,
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
```

### Fix ECR immutability (H2):
```python
# cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py line 44-49
self.ecr_repo = ecr.Repository(
    self, "EcrRepository",
    repository_name="hackathon/app",
    image_scan_on_push=True,
    image_tag_mutability=ecr.TagMutability.IMMUTABLE,  # ADD THIS LINE
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
```

### Add .gitignore (C9):
```bash
echo "cdk.out/" >> .gitignore
echo "cdk.context.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Add WAF rules (C6):
```python
# cdk/stacks/network_stack.py
self.waf = wafv2.CfnWebACL(
    self, "WafAcl",
    default_action=wafv2.CfnWebACL.DefaultActionProperty(allow={}),
    scope="REGIONAL",
    rules=[
        wafv2.CfnWebACL.RuleProperty(
            name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet",
            priority=1,
            override_action=wafv2.CfnWebACL.OverrideActionProperty(none={}),
            statement=wafv2.CfnWebACL.StatementProperty(
                managed_rule_group_statement=wafv2.CfnWebACL.ManagedRuleGroupStatementProperty(
                    vendor_name="AWS",
                    name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
                )
            ),
            visibility_config=wafv2.CfnWebACL.VisibilityConfigProperty(
                cloud_watch_metrics_enabled=True,
                metric_name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSetMetric",
                sampled_requests_enabled=True
            )
        )
    ],
    visibility_config=wafv2.CfnWebACL.VisibilityConfigProperty(
        cloud_watch_metrics_enabled=True,
        metric_name="WafAcl",
        sampled_requests_enabled=True
    )
)
```

## Test Results

### Contract Tests (18/20 passing):
- ❌ `test_ecr_repository_properties` - Missing ImageTagMutability
- ❌ `test_rds_cluster_properties` - Deprecated API usage

### Integration Tests:
- Not executed (blocked by missing infrastructure components)

---

## Conclusion

The infrastructure implementation has made significant progress (65% functional), but **cannot be deployed to AWS in its current state**. The 11 CRITICAL issues must be resolved first, particularly:

1. Stack dependency injection failures
2. S3 bucket naming conflicts
3. Encryption policy violations
4. Missing core infrastructure (internal ALB, Route 53, ACM)
5. Invalid Bedrock VPC endpoint configuration

Estimated remediation time: **6-10 hours** for CRITICAL issues, **12-18 hours** for full production readiness.

**Recommendation**: Address all CRITICAL blockers before attempting `cdk deploy`.
