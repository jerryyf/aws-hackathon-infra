# Tasks: AWS AgentCore Runtime Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-add-aws-agentcore/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/  
**Tech Stack**: Python 3.11, AWS CDK v2, L1 constructs, pytest  

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)  
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and configuration updates needed for all user stories

**Checkpoint**: Basic project structure ready for implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Deploy Agent Runtime Container (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - basic agent runtime deployment functional

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Configure VPC Networking for Agent Runtimes (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable agent runtimes to run within VPC with proper network isolation for secure access to internal resources

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - VPC networking functional and secure

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Manage IAM Permissions for Agent Runtime Execution (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - IAM permissions properly configured with least-privilege access

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Enable VPC Interface Endpoints for AgentCore (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure AgentCore traffic remains within AWS's private network for regulatory compliance

**Independent Test**: Create VPC endpoints, configure endpoint policies, verify agent runtime invocations route through private endpoint

- [ ] T048 Add stack dependency validation to ensure proper deployment order
- [ ] T049 Run quickstart.md validation to ensure deployment guide accuracy
- [ ] T050 Validate all resource tagging compliance with AWS Well-Architected Framework requirements

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories  
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially by priority (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
  - US2 and US3 are both P2 priority - can be done in either order
- **Contract Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on contract validation passing

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories  
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May benefit from US2 VPC setup but not strictly dependent

### Within Each User Story

- Stack modification tasks follow dependency order within AgentCore stack
- Output tasks depend on resource creation tasks
- Validation tasks depend on configuration tasks
- Tagging tasks can be done in parallel with functional implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T001-T004 can be done in parallel (different files)
- **Foundational Phase**: T005-T007 can be done in parallel (different stacks), T008-T010 sequential  
- **User Stories**: Once foundational complete, US1-US4 can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- **Contract Tests**: T038-T040 can be written and run in parallel
- **Polish Tasks**: T044-T047 can be done in parallel (different concerns)

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch foundational infrastructure together:
Task: "Add ECR repository for agent images to cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py"
Task: "Create IAM execution role in cdk/stacks/security_stack.py"  
Task: "Add IAM permissions policy to execution role"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch User Story 1 output tasks together:
Task: "Add runtime ARN output to stack"
Task: "Add runtime endpoint URL output to stack"
Task: "Add runtime status output to stack"
Task: "Add runtime ID output to stack"
Task: "Add execution role ARN output to stack"
Task: "Add runtime version output to stack"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1  
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with PUBLIC mode
5. Deploy/demo basic agent runtime functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - PUBLIC mode agent runtime)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (VPC networking)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced IAM security)  
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full private networking)
6. Each story adds security/compliance value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1 - highest priority)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2 - VPC networking)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2 - IAM permissions)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (P3 - VPC endpoints)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability  
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **CDK synthesis**: Run `cdk synth` after each major change to validate CloudFormation
- **Stack dependencies**: Follow Network ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí AgentCore deployment order
- **Resource allocation**: Environment-based sizing per research.md recommendations
- **No tests requested**: Focus on implementation and contract validation
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group of parallel tasks
- **Avoid**: Cross-story dependencies that break independence, same-file conflicts when marked [P]
