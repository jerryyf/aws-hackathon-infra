# Specification Quality Checklist: AWS AgentCore Runtime Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All checklist items PASSED**

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification uses infrastructure-agnostic language focusing on capabilities (deploy, configure, manage) rather than specific AWS CDK constructs
- Written from persona perspectives (infrastructure admin, security engineer, DevOps engineer, compliance officer)
- No Python, CloudFormation, or specific AWS API references in requirements - all focused on what needs to be achieved
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific and actionable
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking ECR repository encryption settings)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 10 minutes", "up to 100 MB", "within 2 seconds")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Infrastructure can deploy" rather than "CDK stack creates")
- All user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases cover failure scenarios, boundary conditions, and concurrent operations
- Scope is bounded to AgentCore runtime infrastructure (excludes agent application development)
- Assumptions section clearly identifies dependencies on AWS service availability, VPC capacity, and AgentCore service limits

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- P1 user story provides MVP capability (basic agent runtime deployment)
- Success criteria are verifiable without knowing the implementation approach
- No leakage of CDK constructs, boto3 SDK calls, or specific AWS resource types into the specification

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality gates passed on first validation.
