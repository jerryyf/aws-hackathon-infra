# Specification Quality Checklist: ECS Stack Infrastructure for Containerized Workloads

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results

**Pass**: All checklist items have been satisfied.

**Rationale**:
- Specification contains no technology-specific implementation details beyond infrastructure requirements
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-054) are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 60 seconds", "99.9% availability", "30% cost reduction")
- Five user stories provide comprehensive coverage of ECS deployment lifecycle with priority ordering
- Edge cases address common failure scenarios (OOM, capacity issues, AZ failures, scaling events)
- Scope is bounded to ECS cluster, task definitions, services, security groups, and IAM roles
- Dependencies clearly identified: NetworkStack (VPC, ALB), StorageStack (ECR), SecurityStack (Secrets Manager)

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` phase.
