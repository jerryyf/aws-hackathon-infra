## Constitution Alignment Issues

### Constitution I: AWS Well-Architected Framework
- ✅ **Security**: WAF with managed rules, KMS encryption for S3, Shield Standard enabled
- ⚠️ **Reliability**: Multi-AZ configured, failover enabled (chaos testing medium priority)
- ⚠️ **Cost Optimization**: No tagging strategy implemented (medium priority)

### Constitution II: Infrastructure as Code Excellence
- ✅ **Secrets Management**: DB secrets in Secrets Manager, S3 using KMS encryption
- ⚠️ **Environment-Agnostic**: Some values hardcoded (medium priority for parameterization)

### Constitution III: Security & Compliance First
- ✅ **Encryption**: All S3 buckets use KMS-managed keys, RDS storage encrypted
- ✅ **Network Isolation**: All VPC endpoints configured correctly

### Constitution IV: Code Quality & Maintainability
- ⚠️ **Type Safety**: Missing type hints on __init__ methods (low priority)
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: No docstrings on stacks (low priority)
- ✅ **Testing Coverage**: All contract tests pass, integration tests available

### Constitution VI: Observability & Operational Excellence
- ⚠️ **Runbooks**: Quickstart.md exists but not fully validated (medium priority)
- ⚠️ **Metrics & Alarms**: CloudWatch configured, some references may need updates (medium)

---

## Unmapped Tasks

All 48 tasks in tasks.md are mapped to requirements. However, **verification tasks (T047, T048) marked complete without evidence**:
- T047: "Run quickstart.md validation scenarios" - No quickstart.md validation section exists
- T048: "Final linting and code cleanup" - Deprecation warnings remain

2. **Implement tagging strategy** for cost management (medium priority)
3. **Add environment parameterization** (medium priority)
4. **Integrate Cognito authentication** with ALB (medium priority)

### RECOMMENDED (Post-MVP):

## Remediation Examples

### Fix stack cross-references (C1):
```python
# cdk/app.py line 21-25
database_stack = DatabaseStack(app, "DatabaseStack", env=env, network_stack=network_stack)
compute_stack = ComputeStack(app, "ComputeStack", env=env, network_stack=network_stack)
monitoring_stack = MonitoringStack(app, "MonitoringStack", env=env, logs_bucket=storage_stack.logs_bucket)
```

### Fix S3 bucket names (C2) and encryption (C3):
```python
# cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py - remove bucket_name parameters entirely
self.knowledge_base_bucket = s3.Bucket(
    self, "KnowledgeBaseBucket",
    # bucket_name="hackathon-knowledge-base",  # REMOVE THIS LINE
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED,  # Fix C3
    versioned=True,
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
```

### Fix ECR immutability (H2):
```python
# cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py line 44-49
self.ecr_repo = ecr.Repository(
    self, "EcrRepository",
    repository_name="hackathon/app",
    image_scan_on_push=True,
    image_tag_mutability=ecr.TagMutability.IMMUTABLE,  # ADD THIS LINE
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
```

### Add .gitignore (C9):
```bash
echo "cdk.out/" >> .gitignore
echo "cdk.context.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Add WAF rules (C6):
```python
# cdk/stacks/network_stack.py
self.waf = wafv2.CfnWebACL(
    self, "WafAcl",
    default_action=wafv2.CfnWebACL.DefaultActionProperty(allow={}),
    scope="REGIONAL",
    rules=[
        wafv2.CfnWebACL.RuleProperty(
            name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet",
            priority=1,
            override_action=wafv2.CfnWebACL.OverrideActionProperty(none={}),
            statement=wafv2.CfnWebACL.StatementProperty(
                managed_rule_group_statement=wafv2.CfnWebACL.ManagedRuleGroupStatementProperty(
                    vendor_name="AWS",
                    name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
                )
            ),
            visibility_config=wafv2.CfnWebACL.VisibilityConfigProperty(
                cloud_watch_metrics_enabled=True,
                metric_name="AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSetMetric",
                sampled_requests_enabled=True
            )
        )
    ],
    visibility_config=wafv2.CfnWebACL.VisibilityConfigProperty(
        cloud_watch_metrics_enabled=True,
        metric_name="WafAcl",
        sampled_requests_enabled=True
    )
)
```
